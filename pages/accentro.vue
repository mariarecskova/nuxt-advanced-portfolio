      I worked on the website of this real estate company, that has its
      headquarters in Berlin, and it is specialised on the sales of private
      apartments within Germany.<br />The webapplication was built with React
      and next.js frameworks. We used Typescript as a language. The user can
      search and filter for apartments, register, upload documents, and send
      messages to the brokers. The website also displays relevant informations
      and news about the property market in Berlin. <br />I worked on different
      features (UI improvements, user account creation, document upload, news
      display and chart display with the help of Contenful (headless CMS. I
      implemented several end-to-end test with Cypress, and I wrote nearly the
      complete documentation of the project in the internal GitHub Wiki.
