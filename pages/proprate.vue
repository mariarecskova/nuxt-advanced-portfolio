      I worked on this project for a short time, when the workload was less by
      ACCENTRO. PropRate is a free tool to analyze real estate.<br />The
      webapplication was built with React and next.js frameworks, using also
      Typescript as a language. The user can rate and compare apartments for
      sale within Germany.<br />I worked on smaller UI features (UI
      improvements, user account creation and password check. I implemented
      end-to-end test with Cypress.
