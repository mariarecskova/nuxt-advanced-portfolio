      I worked on this project for a short time, when the workload was less by
      ACCENTRO. PropRate is a free tool to analyze real estate. The company
      behind it is Commit Services GmbH from Berlin.<br />The webapplication was
      built with React and next.js frameworks, using also Typescript as a
      language. The user can rate and compare apartments for sale within
      Germany.<br />I worked on smaller UI features (UI improvements, user
      account creation and password check. I implemented end-to-end test with
      Cypress.
