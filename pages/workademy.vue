      The internship was organized as part of the Wild Code School training
      program. We developed the admin part of the Smart Course Builder
      application, using React, Redux and styled components. I was coding
      smaller components in the beginning (buttons, home page, clickable
      sidebar) and then I was responsible for theming (light and dark mode)
      using React hooks and Context API
